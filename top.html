# üëã Hey there!
I'm Myra and I have some amazing free features including **leveling**, **music**, **moderation**, **twitch notification** and much more!

# üìª You like hearing music?
Mee too! First you need to join a voice channel the bot should go into. For this use the command **~join**. Make sure I'm not in a voice channel yet. You don't want to disturb other people hearing music...<br/>
Once I joined your voice channel you're good to go. Use **~play** to play some amazing songs (or annoying). The music tracks will be added to an queue, which is played in the correct order.<br/>
You don't link the order? No problem! Use **~shuffle** to mix up the queue. Then noone knows where his favorite song was.<br/>
If you're done with the super mega music party use **~leave** to let the bot leave the voice channel. She then also wants to rest a little.

# üèÜ I want to make a contest with my friends!
Well, what would be a bot without leveling? Just write some messages and you'll gain experience. With a certain amout of xp you reach a level. But don't take it too easy. It's getting harder to reach a level every time!<br/>
You wan't to check your level? Use **~rank** to see your current **xp**, **level** and **rank**. I'll display it to you on a nice image, which you can customise using **~leveling background**!<br/>
And if you want to see, who the contest won you can type in **~leaderboard**. This will show you the 10 most annoying users! *Reminder: You should be on the top of this list*

# üìö So what can it do?
Here's a short list! Of course, the more Arrows you add to Quiver, the more features you can add to it (that's the whole point)!
<table width="100%" align="center" text-align="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Short Description</th>
    <th>Usage</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://nestedvariables.tk/quiver/commands?cmd=set">set</a></td>
    <td>Changes settings for the whole guild</td>
    <td>[prefix]set prefix {prefix} <br/> set locale {<a href="#-languages">locale</a>}
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://nestedvariables.tk/quiver/commands?cmd=arrows">arrows</td>
    <td>Displays a list of arrows that are currently loaded and enabled</td>
    <td>[prefix]arrows</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="https://nestedvariables.tk/quiver/commands?cmd=reload">reload</a></td>
    <td>Reloads Quiver to integrate new changes</td>
    <td>[prefix]reload</td>
  </tr>
</table>

# üè≥ Languages!
We want to make Quiver accessible to anyone, so we aim to integrate as many languages as we can! Quiver has an _extremely super ultra simple_ translation system that supports any language! If you would like to contribute and translate Quiver to another language, we'd really appreciate it! Here's a cheeky link to some translation instructions: (coming soooooon, I swear).

<table width="100%" align="center" text-align="center">

    <th>Language</th>
    <th>Locale Code</th>

    <td>United States English</td>
    <td>en_US</td>
