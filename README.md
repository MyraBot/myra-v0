# âœ¨ Myra v1

This is the first version of Myra. It's written in Java, and it was my first ever project. I didn't use git from the start so
this repository doesn't show the whole process. Because this was my first ever project you will
find some very dirty code. I advise you to not copy code from here. Use the code snippets to get inspiration on how to do things,
but not to just copy and paste in your project. Also, this Bot uses a very old Disocrd API version and probably won't work well with
the new changes. Hope you can find some helpful things here!
