      # 👋 Hey there!
      I'm a multipurpose Discord bot, including some amazing features, like **leveling**, **music**, **economy** and **media notifications**! All this and much more for free!

      # 📻 You like hearing music?
      Me too! First you need to join a voice channel the bot should go into. For this use the command **~join**. Make sure I'm not in a voice channel yet. You don't want to disturb other people hearing music...<br/>
      Once I joined your voice channel you're good to go. Use **~play** to play some amazing songs (or annoying). The music tracks will be added to an queue, which is played in the correct order.<br/>
      You don't link the order? No problem! Use **~shuffle** to mix up the queue. Then noone knows where his favorite song was.<br/>
      If you're done with the super mega music party use **~leave** to let the bot leave the voice channel. She then also wants to rest a little.

      # 🏆 Who's the most active?
      Well, what would be a bot without leveling? Just write some messages and you'll gain experience. If you're in a voice call with your friends, you'll gain experience as well. With a certain amout of xp you reach a level. But don't take it too easy. It's getting harder to reach a level every time!
      <br/> You wan't to check your level? Use `~rank` to see your current **xp**, **level** and **rank**. I'll display it to you on a nice image, which you can customise using **~leveling background**!<br/>
      If you want to see who is the most active on your server, type in `~leaderboard`. This will show you the 10 most annoying users!

      # 🔔 Ping!
      You missed the latest stream/video of your favorite content creator? Not anymroe! Add all your favorite streamers to a list using the command `~notifications twitch <streamer>`. The same works with YouTube! Use `~notifications youtube <YouTube channel>` to get notifications from a YouTuber!
      <br\> If you want to see, who you added to your notifications list type in **~notifications list**. With the reaction below the message you can toggle between all YouTubers and Streamers.
      <br\> If your favorite streamer banned you from the stream use the same command as you added the streamer: `~notifications twitch <streamer>`. This will remove the streamer from the notifications list! Now you won't be notified if the streamer goes live... For YouTubers its the same, just use **~notifications youtube <YouTube channel>** again.
      <br\> You want to ping a role once you're live? Set up custom notification messages for YouTube and Twitch! Use `~notifications message twitch <message>` to add a custom message once you're streamers are live! As always, do the same for YouTube: `~notifications message youtube <message>`
      <br\> Keep in mind, that this only works for Twitch streamers and YouTube channels.

      # Reaction roles!
      Reaction roles is a must need for every bot. So how can I set up some? Honestly... It's very easy!
      <br\> **1.**  First write the message where your reaction role should go!
